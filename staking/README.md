# Staking Smart Contract

A production-ready staking contract with reward distribution, lock periods, and emergency controls.

## Overview

This contract implements a comprehensive staking system that supports:
- Single staking per user (one stake per address)
- Time-based reward calculation
- Configurable lock periods
- Emergency pause functionality
- Reward claiming and withdrawal mechanisms
- Administrative controls for reward rates and lock durations

## Contract Structure

### Core Components

```solidity
struct Staker {
    uint256 amountStaked;    // Amount of tokens staked
    uint256 rewardDebt;      // Total rewards claimed
    uint256 lastUpdated;     // Timestamp of last interaction
}
```

### Storage
- `mapping(address => Staker) public stakers` - Maps user to their staking data
- `IERC20 public token` - The token being staked
- `uint256 public rewardRate` - Reward rate per second per token
- `uint256 public lockDuration` - Minimum staking duration

## Functions

### User Functions

```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused
```

**Parameters:**
- `amount` - Amount of tokens to stake

**Features:**
- Validates amount is greater than 0
- Ensures user hasn't already staked
- Transfers tokens from user to contract

function calculateReward(address _user) public view returns(uint256)
```

**Parameters:**
- `_user` - Address to calculate rewards for

**Features:**
- Returns 0 if user hasn't staked

```solidity
function claimReward() public nonReentrant
```

**Features:**
- Validates user has staked tokens

#### `withdraw()`
Allows users to withdraw their staked tokens after lock period.

```solidity
function withdraw() public nonReentrant
```

- Protected against reentrancy

### Administrative Functions

#### `setRewardRate()`
Allows owner to adjust the reward rate.

```solidity
function setRewardRate(uint256 _rewardRate) external onlyOwner
```

**Parameters:**
- `_rewardRate` - New reward rate per second per token

**Features:**
- Only owner can modify

#### `pause()` / `unpause()`
Emergency pause functionality.

```solidity
function pause() external onlyOwner
function unpause() external onlyOwner
```

**Features:**

- Allows emergency control
- Only owner can pause/unpause

#### `emergencyWithdraw()`
Allows owner to withdraw stuck tokens.

```solidity

```

**Parameters:**
- `_token` - Token address to withdraw
- `_amount` - Amount to withdraw

**Features:**

- Emergency recovery mechanism

## Reward Calculation

### Formula
```
timeStaked = block.timestamp - lastUpdated
pendingReward = (amountStaked * timeStaked * rewardRate) / 1e12
```

### Components
- **amountStaked**: User's staked token amount
- **timeStaked**: Time since last interaction
- **rewardRate**: Reward rate per second per token
- **1e12**: Scaling factor for precision

### Example
```
User stakes 1000 tokens
Reward rate: 1e12 (1 token per second per 1e12 tokens)
Time staked: 86400 seconds (1 day)
Reward = (1000 * 86400 * 1e12) / 1e12 = 86400 tokens
```

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Owner-only functions**: Administrative functions restricted to owner
- **User restrictions**: Users can only interact with their own stakes

### Reentrancy Protection
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks on claim and withdraw
- **SafeERC20**: Secure token transfers with proper error handling

### Input Validation
- **Amount validation**: Ensures staking amounts are positive
- **Stake validation**: Prevents multiple stakes per user
- **Time validation**: Ensures lock periods are respected

### Emergency Controls
- **Pausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Emergency withdrawal**: Recovery mechanism for stuck tokens

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Storage
- **Compact struct**: Optimized staker data structure
- **Single stake per user**: Reduces storage complexity

### Optimized Functions
- **Early returns**: Functions return early on validation failures
- **Single transfer**: Efficient token transfers

### Storage Management
- **Delete operation**: Removes user data after withdrawal
- **Minimal storage reads**: Efficient state access patterns

## Events

### `Staked`
Emitted when a user stakes tokens.

```solidity
event Staked(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
```

### `Withdraw`
Emitted when a user withdraws their staked tokens.

```solidity
event Withdraw(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
```

### `ClaimReward`
Emitted when a user claims their rewards.

```solidity
event ClaimReward(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
```

### `LockDuration`
Emitted when lock duration is updated.

```solidity
event LockDuration(uint256 LockDuration);
```

## Usage Examples

### Staking Tokens
```solidity
// Approve tokens for staking
token.approve(stakingContract, 1000000000000000000000); // 1000 tokens

// Stake tokens
stakingContract.stake(1000000000000000000000); // 1000 tokens
```

### Checking Rewards
```solidity
// Calculate pending rewards
uint256 rewards = stakingContract.calculateReward(userAddress);

// Claim rewards
stakingContract.claimReward();
```

### Withdrawing Staked Tokens
```solidity
// Withdraw after lock period
stakingContract.withdraw();
```

### Administrative Functions
```solidity
// Set reward rate (owner only)
stakingContract.setRewardRate(2e12); // 2 tokens per second per 1e12 tokens

// Set lock duration (owner only)
stakingContract.setLockDuration(30 days);

// Emergency pause (owner only)
stakingContract.pause();
```
